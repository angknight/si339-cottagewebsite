                On the North West side of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldwater_Lake_(Michigan)">Coldwater Lake</a> on a dead end road sits a modest two story cottage. Until an addition that was made a few years ago, there was only one bathroom and a kitchen the size of a supply closet. There are a few bedrooms upstairs with as many beds as possible. The yard leads to the beach of Coldwater lake. There is a shallow area where children play in the water and a dock that leads deeper into the water where people enjoy jumping off. This is the place that my moms entire extended family is welcome to come visit every summer. This is the Cottage.

            <h2 id="borderimg1">History</h2>

            <p>My great grandparents lived in Fort Wayne Indiana and had ten children. As one might imagine, it is challenging to vaccion with ten children to account for. This is why my great grandparents had the idea of renting a cottage on a lake in the summer as a place their family could vacation to. They chose to rent a cottage at 157 Idlewild Beach on Coldwater Lake in Michigan. Their children loved spending their summer there and it was less than an hour from Fort Wayne which made it easy to get to. It took one summer for my grandparents to decide they should purchase the cottage. From then on, their whole family would spend almost all of the summer there and once those ten children started having families of their own, they also started coming.
