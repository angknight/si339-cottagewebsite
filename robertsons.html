        <p>It was my great grandparents who bought the Cottage on Coldwater Lake. After they passed, the ownership of the house was split between their ten children. Each of the ten childs, and their descending family would get to spend one week of the summer at the Cottage. My grandma, Joanne, was the oldest of the ten children. She married my grandfather Malcom and they had five children, who eventually had children including myself, my brother, and my cousins. My extended family have always lived across the country from me, but every year we all gathered at the Cottage on Coldwater Lake for one week of the summer. This time is very special to me because it how I have gotten to know and stay close with my extended family despite how far we live from each other the rest of the year.

            <p>The weeks at the Cottage run Friday night to the following Friday morning. If youâ€™re not careful the days can slip away quickly and before you know it your important week is over. When I am there for my week with the rest of the Robertson clan, we like to make the most of every day. That means finding things to do even when the weather is not in our favor. On sunny days you could find my cousins and I riding on paddleboards, playing king of the raft in the deeper water, tubing, water skiing, jumping off the dock, or just relaxing in the cooling water. If the weather is stroming, it is likely we are inside playing euchre, spoons, charades or hearts. Being a part of a classic midwest family means I learned how to play euchre as soon as I could. My family and I love spending time together playing games, especially card games. My memories of playing games with my family are filled with laughter and joy.

        <p>One of the Robertson family's traditions that we make sure to do every summer is our boat chain tour. Coldwater lake is at the end of a chain of six lakes connected by channels. The boat chain tour is where we pile all the kids and adults willing to go along into the speedboat and make our way through the adjacent lakes. There are many great things about the boat chain tour like counting the number of turtles we can find in the channels, stopping to swim the lakes we pass through, and enjoying the beautiful surroundings; but nothing tops stopping at the dinky old gas station three lake into the trip for some refreshing ice cream. When my cousins were younger, the ice cream stop along the boat chain tour was a highly anticipated event. As a young adult now, I still love doing the boat chain tour and of course I still enjoy stopping for ice cream.
