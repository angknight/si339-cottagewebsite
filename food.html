        <p> The Colligan family have been gathering at Coldwater Lake for almost a century. Over those many years, there have been many many meals had on the deck outside near the lake or inside at the dining room table. There are a handful of recipes that are crowd favorites and have been passed down through the generations. My family and I share fond memories of gathering together around meals at the Cottage and eating some of these recipes. These recipes are part of what make the Cottage special and it is something we all look forward to when we visit.
        </p>
        <p>The first recipe that is famous among Colligans is corn pancakes, corn cakes for short. Jiffy Mix is a company based in Michigan that creates baking mixes. One of their popular products is a corn muffin mix. One of my relatives, I am not sure who, noticed on the side of the corn muffin mix box there was a recipe for corn mix pancakes. My relative decided to try the recipe out and discovered it was very tasty. The recipe made its way to the Cottage where children and adults couldn’t get enough. It did not take long after most the family had tried corn cakes for them to become a Cottage breakfast staple. Every summer when I am at the Cottage, I always have corn cakes at least once for breakfast. When we are at home and missing family who are spread across the country, sometimes my mom and I will make them and feel like we are back at the Cottage.

        <p>Another recipe is also a breakfast favorite for many people at the Cottage; we call it lake eggs. Like the corn cakes, I am not sure which of my relatives started the lake eggs trend but I know it's been around since my mom was a kid and came to the lake. Lake eggs is a pretty simple concept, eggs and breakfast sausage. Instead of having eggs and breakfast sausage separately, lake eggs combine them. In a large saucepan, break up the breakfast sausage so it is in little pieces and sauté it until it is fully cooked through. Then add in the whisked up eggs with a dash of milk and start scrambling the eggs as you would normally. In the end it will be scrambled eggs with breakfast sausage mixed throughout. It is not a complex idea but it is very good. With lots of little kids who need to eat breakfast and can’t fix anything themselves, lake eggs is a yummy and easy solution that everyone can get behind.
